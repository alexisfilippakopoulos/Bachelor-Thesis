## Personalized Federated Learning over Resource Constrained Devices in a Split Learning Setting

### Abstract

Advances in wireless connectivity have tremendously facilitated the accretive incorporation of IoT devices (i.e sensors, 'smart' gadgets, etc) in our daily lives; as a result, an unprecedented volume of decentralized and unevenly distributed data has been brought into existence. Simultaneously, an increasing number of people familiarize themselves with artificial intelligence through daily interactions, thus recognising its potential as a powerful tool that can facilitate their everyday lives. Therefore, a need to leverage this data ubiquity for machine learning is created, in conjunction with a need for frameworks that can be deployed in these resource constrained environments. This study focuses on a novel framework, SplitGP (\cite{han2023splitgp}), aiming to concurrently capture both device-specific personalization and network-wide generalization. Precisely, it intents of achieving this by equipping each edge device (client) with a personalized and use-case specific model, capable of inferring on its local tasks, while having a centralized node (server) coordinating the process with a goal of generalizing the networkâ€™s knowledge by making inferences across all client-specific tasks. To accomplish this, the authors employ an integration of existing Split Learning and Personalized Federated Learning techniques while being mindful of communication latency and costs.
